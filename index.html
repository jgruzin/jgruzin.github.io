<h1 style="color: red"> Who is Edward Snowden? </h1>
<p style="font size: 10px;"> Edward Joseph "Ed" Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA), starting in June 2013. A former system administrator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a counterintelligence trainer at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he later worked for the private intelligence contractor Dell inside an NSA outpost in Japan. In March 2013, he joined the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton inside the NSA center in Hawaii.[3] In June 2013, he came to international attention after disclosing to several media outlets thousands of classified documents that he acquired while working as an NSA contractor[4] for Dell[5] and Booz Allen Hamilton. Snowden's leaked documents revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many of them run by the NSA and the Five Eyes with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a patriot, and a traitor. His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy. Two court rulings since the initial leaks have split on the constitutionality of the NSA's bulk collection of telephone metadata.

<h2>Edward Snowden and the Illuminati</h2>
<body><p>Edward snowden's message to the American people about the NSA can tie the NSA in with the illuminati. One of the goals of the illuminati is to gain complete control over all people. By listening into Calls the NSA shows similar traits as the illuminati in their mission. The most significant factor is that one can type in www.itanimulli.com into their url bar and the nsa website combes up. itanimulli is illuminati spelled backwards. Half life three confirmed?</p></body>

<ul>
	<li>Thomas Eckert</li>
	<li>Thomas Eckerly</li>
	<li>THOMAS Murtaugh</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can conclude three things</p>
<ol>
	<li>Thomas Eckert is Thomas Eckerly from the past who invented a time machine to see his future life.</li>
	<li>There are two history teachers names Thomas therefore the illuminati is clearly trying to create uniformity in the names of teachers by subject</li>
	<li>Three thomas, three conclusions, triangles have three sides. This is clearly linked to the illuminati. Half life 3 confirmed.	</li>
